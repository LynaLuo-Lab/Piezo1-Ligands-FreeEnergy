 Statistics for hypothesis in full matching mode:
 There are           20  hypotheses (full matching mode) if considering            3  SILCS features at once.
 There are           15  hypotheses (full matching mode) if considering            4  SILCS features at once.
 There are            6  hypotheses (full matching mode) if considering            5  SILCS features at once.
 There are            1  hypotheses (full matching mode) if considering            6  SILCS features at once.
 If you want to use hypothesis in full matching mode, please modify the ph4 files in MOE or with a text editor.
  
 The number of key features varies from 3 to    6.
 Please look at: silcs_pharm/yoda_open_ordered.features.dat file for all features in the increasing order of FGFE score.
 You can select features on your own to build a specific hyphothesis other than the suggested one.
